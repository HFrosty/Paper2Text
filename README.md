# Paper2Text
Python program that takes a pdf research paper and convert it to a plain text file.

## How to use
To use the script, you need to have Python3 installed on your computer. You can then run the script by typing 'python3 paper2Text.py folder options". The first argument (folder) is a folder that contains the PDFs files you want to convert. The output files are located in the folder named "output" inside the program folder. The second argument (option) is the option for the output files. Type -t or let empty for a plain text conversion, type -x for an xml conversion.  

The program then opens and prompt you to select which files you want to convert. You can choose them by inputting their id. You can then input 'c' to launch the conversion.
